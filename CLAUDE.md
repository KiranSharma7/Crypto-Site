ðŸ“– Project Description for News Templates Repository
Overview

The News Templates Project is a large-scale initiative to design and develop 1,000 responsive HTML/CSS templates tailored for online news websites. These templates will cover a wide range of layout styles (grid, magazine, minimal, modern, dark/light, etc.), providing reusable designs for media platforms, publishers, and developers.

The goal is to deliver a comprehensive template library that is:

Responsive â†’ Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Lightweight & Semantic â†’ Built with clean HTML5 and structured CSS.

Consistent & Scalable â†’ Follows a strict coding standard and naming convention.

Customizable â†’ Easy to adapt for different news categories (sports, entertainment, finance, politics, lifestyle, etc.).

Motivation

News websites often need fast, reliable, and professional layouts. Instead of designing each one from scratch, this project provides a ready-to-use collection of templates that saves time and ensures quality.

By leveraging base layouts and expanding them into variations, we can reach 1,000 unique templates without compromising on structure or maintainability.

Key Features

Base Layouts: A set of 10â€“15 master designs that serve as foundations.

Template Variations: Hundreds of stylistic variations derived from base layouts.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for all devices and screen sizes.

Accessible: Built with WCAG principles (semantic tags, alt attributes, ARIA).

Organized Repository: Templates stored in /templates with numbering (template-001, template-002, â€¦).

Preview Index: A master index.html linking to all templates with thumbnails.

Automated QA: GitHub Actions workflow for validating HTML & linting CSS.

Project Scale & Team Workflow

Team Size: 4 members (1 lead, 2 developers, 1 QA/documentation).

Branching Convention: Each template is developed in its own branch (template/001, template/002, â€¦).

Development Flow:

Create a branch for the new template.

Build template in /templates/template-###.

Add screenshot & update index.html.

Open a pull request to develop.

QA validates â†’ Merge to develop â†’ Later merged to main.

Deliverables

1000 HTML Templates stored under /templates.
